## INTRODUCTION
As the 2020 U.S. Presidential election is coming closer, increasingly more people are becoming involved in the corresponding informational field, including me.
Being a permanent resident of the U.S. and studying public policy, I am more than simply interested in this topic. I am highly concerned about it.
That is why I searched for some actual statistics on the states' political affiliation. Eventually, I came across the following The Nation magazine's article:
[Democrats Are Winning Their Fight for the States](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democrats-elections-statehouses/)
<br/>
<br/>
It made me curious and I dived into the reading. But before I discuss my findings, I feel I need first to share my impression of what I read.
As a Russian, I am all hands for true democracy but this article made me really angry.
Based on this piece of writing, I found The Nation magazine egregiously left-biased media.
I have never read them before and will never do after this extremely unpleasant experience.
It is absolutely fascinating how they manipulate statistics, twist facts, distort information, and misinterpret data. It’s been utterly abhorrent to me.
That’s enough for emotions, let’s go to constructive data visualization critique.

## DISCUSSION
In the article, The Nation even did not make a slight effort to show visual evidence to convince their readers of what they are trying to prove.
In fact, their chart that I am presenting below demonstrates the situation exactly opposite to the described one, which plays directly against their logic embedded in the title:
