# PART 2
## WIREFRAMES AND STORYBOARDS
I decided to use as the base for my storyboard the one I drew for Part 1 (see link above). To make it more easy-to-understand, I recreated the charts in Tableau, Excel, and PowerPoint.
Once I'd spent many hours trying to educate myself on how to build different types of dataviz in Tableau, I was terribly happy to discover that ArcGIS Pro StoryMaps do not
embed interactive charts from this program. It says,
> This content isn't supported. The web content you've added
> does not support live embedding. / This website does not support inline embedding.

But this did not stop me and I decided to make selection screen captures instead. While with Flourish everything worked well.
<br/>
Those draft versions of my graphics from Tableau and Excel I added to the StoryMaps and worked there since then.

## USER RESEARCH AND INTERVIEWS
### INTERVIEWEES
Since my main target audience is the labor-related government as was described in Part I and since it would be unrealistic for me to reach out to real policy-makers
from there at this point, I was searching for those individuals who are not only highly conversant with the discussing issues and are cognizant of the ongoing changes
in our region’s economy and labor market, but also who have strong connections with the government and possess a variety of tools and capabilities for advocating for
the proposed regional policies and mobilizing leadership forces.
<br/>
Of course, that is the Allegheny Conference on Community Development (ACCD). All my three interviewees are/have been working for this influential at
the South-Western Pennsylvania scale organization and all of them I know in person. I would describe the first one a *“Big Boss,”* the second – *“Right-Hand of BB,”*
and the third – *“My CMU Fellow and Former Companion at ACCD.”*
### PROTOCOL
#### INTRODUCTION
“First, thank you for taking time to have a chat with me today. My goal is to get to know your observations on a storyboard that I’ve designed for my project on a theme
I am passionate about. Your feedback will remain anonymous, and our talk would take less than 10 minutes. There are no right or wrong answers, any your thoughts and
comments would be greatly appreciated.”
#### MAIN TALK
“Once you’ve got acquainted with the storyboard, I ask you just five brief questions. You do not need to go deep into profound and detailed answers.
Your first impression would be the most valuable since the target audience of this project will not have more than two minutes to figure out what I am going to deliver
for them.”
<br/>
<br/>
**Questions.**
1. Did you get what is the problem? If yes, what is this and do you find it urgent?
2. Is it clear enough what the proposed solution is? Would you support it?
3. Is something here you want to learn more about?
4. Did you find something confusing?
5. What would you recommend improving?
#### WRAP-UP
“Thank you very much for your time and your feedback. Should you have any follow-up questions please feel free to reach out to me at akolesni@andrew.cmu.edu.”
### FINDINGS FROM THE CONVERSATIONS
#### 1. Big Boss (BB)
First of all, I want to say that It’s been a true miracle to have a chance to talk to her this week given her extreme busyness and tight schedule.
We had been planning to have a meeting for weeks but because of ongoing craziness around it was really hard to find a time convenient for both of us.
Luckily, when we finally managed to arrange a call, this time coincided with the second week of working on the Final project at the Telling Stories with Data class
and I was able to ask BB relevant to it questions.
<br/>
<br/>
What I’ve learned from her, is that I should be more focused on particular actions that I am going to present to the defined audience.
She confirmed that she understood the problem and my call to action but from her perspective, it would be better if I concentrated on a more precise description
of the necessary steps to take. So, the key takeaway for me from our conversation was to add clarifying information on the proposed solution.
#### 2. Right-Hand of BB
