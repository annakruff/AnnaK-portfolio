# PART 3
## INTENDED AUDIENCE
As was described in Part I, my target audience initially was the local government accounting for workforce development. However, since I am going to present the project to my fellows and given the recommendations I received from Professor and TA to Part I, I adjusted the content to my classmates as well.
<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that graduate students might represent both entrepreneurs and job-seekers, I appealed to their thoughts and emotions as those of potential stakeholders of my initiative. In particular, first, I did my best to create a sense of urgency and seriousness of the problem to them. To fix the effect, I played out a dialogue addressing their possible objections.
<br/>
<br/>
Second, over the following next sections, I thoroughly explained how existing Pittsburgh strengths that resident students must be proud of can serve as a remedy to the identified problem and how they personally can benefit from it being in the role of either a business representative or an individual searching for ways to advance their career. To make this clearer, I articulated the exact power of the Talent Hub by constructing its pitch in the imaginary dialogue with either an individual looking for a job or a businessman so that the audience viewing my presentation would be able to quickly grasp key ideas beneficial to themselves as Professor suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
I ended up my story with the clear call to action to my audience to be active in promoting the proposed initiative and push this forward to the officials‚Äô attention.
<br/>
<br/>
## SUMMARY OF THE WORK
It‚Äôs been a long journey from the project idea creation to its final delivery; from rough sketches by hand to detailed chart drawings in Tableau. But it was totally worth it.
<br/>
<br/>
While the first part of the project was based mainly on independent brainstorming and hard-research work, the second and third parts were full of invaluable insights from other people: friends, colleagues, and of course classmates. Undoubtedly, the final version of the project could not have been created with the same efficiency if any of these parts had been missed.
<br/>
<br/>
However, I personally found the first stage of the whole process the most productive despite it was less technical than the next ones. Part I allowed me to put my thoughts together, structure them, and outline the key ideas of my future story. Once achieved some kind of ‚Äúpicture integrity‚Äù in my mind, I was able to move further with the deeper research and to create more meaningful dataviz.
<br/>
<br/>
Part II enabled me to look at my storyboard ideas through other eyes. My interviewees helped me identify ‚Äúweak spots‚Äù in my train of thought and make the narrative more persuasive. Interestingly, despite very different social portraits and professional backgrounds of my reviewers, in most cases, they pointed out similar things that I should improve.
<br/>
<br/>
And I certainly did it in the Final Part. Namely, I redesigned the opening part of my story by changing the type of dataviz (which original version nobody liked üòä ) and adding more context to rule out the confusion; and I modified the key part with the main proposal by creating a couple of concept-descriptive infoviz and supplementing it with the explanatory comments as all three interviewees suggested.
<br/>
<br/>
In the middle of the story, I also replaced the original charts with more self-telling and digestible ones. Specifically, I decided that the viewer should focus on no more than one thing at a time and be able to easily compare contrasting things that I present (‚Äúbefore-after,‚Äù  ‚Äúdemand-supply‚Äù). In addition, I complemented each graphics with supportive information for better reader‚Äôs understanding.
<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I put some examples of real programs‚Äîsimilar to what I am proposing‚Äîso that anybody interested in the topic might get directly to them and learn more. Finally, I wrapped up with the relevant to the audience I am going to present this project urgent call to action.
