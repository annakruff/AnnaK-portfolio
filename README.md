Here is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU! :)

# About me
My intro on Handshake's profile (Anna Kolesnikova, she/her/her) states: "Determined to be the one whose policy analysis can do nothing but lead to real-life tangible results."
This is the only reason I decided to get a Master's degree at Heinz College in the Master of Science in Public Policy and Management Program, once started a brand new life in the U.S. after emigration.

During my 7-year professional experience in business analysis at the for-profit organization, I received strong training in working with big data and then developing and implementing solutions based on them. However, I always felt I could be a better asset in public policy by applying my skills at a much larger scale than just one company or even one market. That is why I've chosen this educational path.

# What I hope to learn
Funny, but the very first sentence in my essay to CMU Admissions was the following:
"If only I could apply my data storytelling skills to make my government and its policy-making better."
I believe this is enough to explain why I decided to take the Telling Stories with Data class.
Being able to crunch numbers is good, but possessing this skill coupled with the talent to communicate them in an effective and digestible way is better. I am certain this class will help me to become an expert in it!
